# Dart Cheatsheet Exercises

> This repository contains solutions to practice exercises from the [Dart
> cheatsheet codelab](https://dart.dev/codelabs/dart-cheatsheet).

## Overview

The Dart cheatsheet codelab covers important features of the Dart language. It provides a brief description of each feature along with practice exercises to test the reader's understanding of the material. This repository contains my solutions to the practice exercise for each topic listed below.

- String interpolation
- Nullable variables
- Null-aware operators
- Conditional property access
- Collection literals
- Arrow syntax
- Cascades
- Getter and setters
- Optional positional parameters
- Exceptions
- Using this in a constructor
- Initializer lists
- Named constructor
- Factory constructors
- Redirecting constructors
- Const constructors

## Usage

The main Dart project file is located in the `/bin` folder(e.g., ex01_string_interpolation.dart).
This file imports a Dart file containing a solution for its corresponding exercise. It tests the solution via the exercise.test() function. You can run this project file in the CLI with the command `dart run fileNameHere`. When the main project file is run, the console should output a 'pass' or 'fail' message indicating if the solution is correct.

The solution for each execise is located in the `/lib` folder(e.g., stringify.dart). Each solution is accompanied by another Dart file(e.g. ex01_string_interpolation.dart) which is used to test the solution.
